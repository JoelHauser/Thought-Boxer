# Installation

Install the repo, and point your terminal to the root of the application. Enter 'npm install' to install all dependencies for the project. When these have been installed, enter 'npm run develop' to begin the client and server. Default settings will open the page in your default browser, if you have disabled this setting, open your browser to localhost:3001 to see the client running. The sever will be running on port 3001, and can be used to interact directly with the server if you wish to run queries and mutations directly in the sandbox.
To use the live site, go to [the live page for the heroku app.](https://thoughtboxer.herokuapp.com/)

When you are signed in, you'll have a new sidebar that will show your current questions, as well as enable you to make new questions. Use this area if you wish to create a new question. When you create a new question, you will be asked for some information that designates how others will view it. You will be asked for a title, more explanation as to the situation, and two viewpoints that users can vote on. After you submit, you will be able to view your question in the list of questions that populate. Also, in your user area, you'll be able to see how many votes have been casted on your question.
